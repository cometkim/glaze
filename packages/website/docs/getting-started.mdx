## Installation

Install the package and its peer dependencies:

```sh
npm install glaze treat react-treat
```

## Managing design tokens

Design systems establish a consistent user experience across platforms. Built upon [design tokens](https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/), they provide an agnostic way to store information about branding colors, typography and more.

Firstly, define a theme, preferably by overriding the [default tokens](https://github.com/kripod/glaze/blob/master/packages/glaze/src/theme.ts):

```js title="theme.treat.js"
import { createTheme, defaultTokens } from 'glaze';

export default createTheme({
  ...defaultTokens,

  // Customization
  scales: {
    ...defaultTokens.scales,
    color: {
      primary: '#f8485e',
    },
  },
});
```

:::note

<!-- TODO: Remove spaces sorrounding bracketed items -->

Keeping the runtime as small as possible, only a few tokens ( `breakpoints` , `shorthands` and `aliases` ) are embedded into production JavaScript bundles. Other values can only be accessed exclusively for styling, as [shown below](#usage).
:::

Apply the theme through `<ThemeProvider>`, by wrapping the component tree:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'glaze';
import theme from './theme.treat';

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
}
```

:::tip
The [Gatsby plugin for glaze](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-glaze) does this out of the box.

## Static style extraction

A single-purpose CSS class needs to be generated for each design token at build time. This can be [set up by following the instructions of treat](https://seek-oss.github.io/treat/setup/).

Afterwards, selector-based CSS rules may be created with [`globalStyle()`](https://seek-oss.github.io/treat/styling-api/#globalstyle) in `*.treat.{js|ts}` files. They have to be applied as a side effect, e.g. from a top-level layout component:

```js
import './globalStyles.treat'; // {js|ts} file extensions may be omitted
```

## Usage

Style elements with the `sx` function, as [inspired by Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/sx-prop):

```jsx
import { useStyling } from 'glaze';

export default function Component() {
  const sx = useStyling();

  return (
    <p
      className={sx({
        px: 4, // Sets `padding-left` and `padding-right` to `1rem` (from theme)
        color: 'primary', // Sets color to `#f8485e` (from theme)
        backgroundColor: 'red', // Non-tokens are applied as raw CSS values
      })}
    >
      Hello, world!
    </p>
  );
}
```

## Autocompletion for tokens

TODO (`.d.ts`): Can be achieved for additional type safety

## ðŸ¤” How it works - TODO: Move this to an other page

- The `sx` function maps themed values to statically generated class names
  - If that fails, the style gets injected dynamically through the CSSOM
- Dynamic styles which are not in use by any component get removed

### Rule handling

1. Transform each alias to its corresponding CSS property name or custom shorthand
2. Resolve values from the scales available
   - CSS properties associated with a custom shorthand are resolved one by one

### Example

Given the theme below:

```js
import { createTheme } from 'glaze';

export default createTheme({
  scales: {
    spacing: { 4: '1rem' },
  },
  shorthands: {
    paddingX: ['paddingLeft', 'paddingRight'],
  },
  aliases: {
    px: 'paddingX',
  },
  resolvers: {
    paddingLeft: 'spacing',
    paddingRight: 'spacing',
  },
});
```

An `sx` parameter is matched to CSS rules as follows:

1. `{ px: 4 }`
2. `{ paddingX: 4 }`, after transforming aliases
3. `{ paddingLeft: 4, paddingRight: 4 }`, after unfolding custom shorthands
4. `{ paddingLeft: '1rem', paddingRight: '1rem' }`, after applying resolvers
