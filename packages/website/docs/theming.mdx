## Setup

### Managing design tokens

Design systems establish a consistent user experience across platforms. They are built upon tokens, which store information about branding colors, typography and more.

Firstly, define a theme, preferably by overriding the [default tokens](https://github.com/kripod/glaze/blob/master/packages/glaze/src/presets/defaultTokens.ts):

```js title="theme.treat.js"
import { createTheme, defaultTokens } from 'glaze';

export default createTheme({
  ...defaultTokens,
  scales: {
    ...defaultTokens.scales,
    // highlight-next-line
    color: { primary: '#d8366b' }, // Example for customization
  },
});
```

:::note
Keeping the runtime as small as possible, only a few tokens (`breakpoints`, `shorthands` and `aliases`) are embedded into production JavaScript bundles. Other values can only be accessed exclusively for styling, as shown in usage.
:::

Apply the theme through `<ThemeProvider>`, by wrapping the component tree:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'glaze';
import theme from './theme.treat';

export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>{children}</ThemeProvider>;
}
```

:::tip
The [Gatsby plugin for glaze](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-glaze) does this out of the box.
:::

### Precise autocompletion

Being written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), glaze offers extensive type safety. To activate theme-agnostic code suggestions, include the following snippet in your project:

```ts title="treat.d.ts"
import { tokens } from './theme.treat'; // The previously written theme

declare module 'treat/theme' {
  type Tokens = typeof tokens;
  export interface Theme extends Tokens {}
}
```

### Static style extraction

A single-purpose CSS class needs to be generated for each design token at build time. This can be [set up by following the instructions of treat](https://seek-oss.github.io/treat/setup/).

:::tip
Multiple integrations are available for treat, including a [Gatsby plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-plugin-treat) and a [Next.js plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-treat).
:::

Afterwards, selector-based CSS rules may be created with [`globalStyle()`](https://seek-oss.github.io/treat/styling-api/#globalstyle) in `*.treat.{js|ts}` files. They have to be applied as a side effect, e.g. from a top-level layout component:

```js
import './globalStyles.treat'; // {js|ts} file extensions may be omitted
```

## Usage

```jsx
export default function Component() {
  return (
    <p
      {/* highlight-start */}
      sx={{
        px: 4, // Sets `padding-left` and `padding-right` to `1rem` (from theme)
        color: 'primary', // Sets color to `#d8366b` (from theme)
        backgroundColor: 'red', // Non-tokens are applied as raw CSS values
      }}
      {/* highlight-end */}
    >
      Hello, world!
    </p>
  );
}
```

## How it works

At first, `sx` tries mapping themed values to statically generated CSS class names. Unresolved rules are injected at runtime and detached when no components reference them anymore.

### Rule handling

1. Transform each alias to its corresponding CSS property name or custom shorthand.
2. Resolve values from a scale if available.
   - Each custom shorthand's associated CSS properties are resolved one by one.

:::note
Aliases and shorthands can be combined. For instance, `px` could be an alias for the `paddingX` shorthand.
:::

### Example

Heavily [influenced by Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/blob/master/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js#L5), the default theme contains settings like below:

```js
import { createTheme } from 'glaze';

export default createTheme({
  /* highlight-start */
  scales: {
    spacing: { 4: '1rem' },
  },
  shorthands: {
    paddingX: ['paddingLeft', 'paddingRight'],
  },
  aliases: {
    px: 'paddingX',
  },
  matchers: {
    paddingLeft: 'spacing',
    paddingRight: 'spacing',
  },
  /* highlight-end */
});
```

Entries of a style object passed to `sx` are matched to CSS rules as shown:

1. `{ px: 4 }`
2. `{ paddingX: 4 }`, after transforming aliases
3. `{ paddingLeft: 4, paddingRight: 4 }`, after unfolding custom shorthands
4. `{ paddingLeft: '1rem', paddingRight: '1rem' }`, after applying matchers
