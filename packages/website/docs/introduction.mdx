## Motivation

This project was born to combine the best of its predecessors into a single solution:

- **Utility-first CSS,** as implemented by [Tailwind CSS][]
  - Fully static, but customizable upfront
  - Embraces reusability with no duplicated rules
- **Constraint-based layouts,** popularized by [Theme UI][]
  - Highly dynamic, thankfully to [Emotion][]
  - One-off styles can be defined naturally
- **Near-zero runtime,** made possible by [treat][]
  - Theming support with legacy browsers in mind
  - Static style extraction while retaining type safety

## Systematic approach

An element's appearance can be customized through objects. Similarly to [`style` attributes in React](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style), properties are camelCased. Aliases and shorthands may also be used (and even defined):

```jsx
function Component() {
  return <p sx={{ bg: '#f9c' /* pink */, paddingX: '1rem' }}>Hello, world!</p>;
}
```

- The `bg` alias will be transformed into `background`
- The `paddingX` shorthand can set `paddingLeft` and `paddingRight` at once

Each value may also be part of a scale. Store [design tokens](https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/) in a theme:

```js title="theme.treat.js"
import { createTheme, defaultTokens } from 'glaze';

export default createTheme({
  ...defaultTokens, // Defines aliases like `bg`, shorthands and more
  scales: {
    ...defaultTokens.scales, // Has several values, e.g. `spacing[4] === '1rem'`
    // highlight-next-line
    color: { highlight: '#f9c' },
  },
});
```

So then, we can rearchitect the initial example in a scalable manner:

```jsx
function Component() {
  return <p sx={{ bg: 'highlight', paddingX: 4 }}>Hello, world!</p>;
}
```

Concepts like these will be thoroughly explained in the next chapters. Follow along and delve into the world of styling with confidence and convenience.
